         <center><h4>Metamaterials</h4></center>
        The behaviour of electromagnetic radiations in the various materials as discussed above assumes that all the medium are homogeneous, isotropic and linear.
        However, some materials that do not have HIL properties can exhibit very interesting and mind
        (and light) - bending behaviour that is the focus of many cutting-edge research.
        <br>
        Click on the right to look at two applications of metamaterials in the manipulation of electromagnetic wave.

        <h5>Negative Index Metamaterials (NIMs)</h5>
        NIMs are materials that have negative refractive indices for electromagnetic waves over certain frequency ranges.
        NIM is a composite material made from repeating unit cells stacked together.
        The first experimentally investigated NIM used wires and dielectrics for its unit cell.
        <br>
        One property that NIMs can exhibit is reverse propagation.
        This allows for the resolution of image below the diffraction limit feasible.
        On top of that, the permittivity and permeability of the NIM can also be tuned by means of how the unit cells are stacked etc.
        Negative permittivity and permeability are also achievable in NIMs.

        <h5>Metamaterial Cloaking</h5>
        The manufacturing of invisibility cloaks using metamaterials that react to electromagnetic radiation in a way that conceal themselves is a focus of transformation optics.
        By controlling the properties of these metamaterials, light can be refracted in a way such that an "invisibility" effect can be achieved theoretically.
        Electromagnetic waves are typically bent around the object, and the behaviour is frequency dependent (dispersion relation). If the range of operable frequency of the material
        encompasses the visible spectrum, cloaking is achieved.
        In principle, an inhomogeneous composite metamaterial can be engineered with the permittivity and permeability or any part varied at will,
        where they conserve the electric field vector $\mathbf{D}$, magnetic field intensity $\mathbf{B}$ and the Poynting vector $\mathbf{S}$.
        Such a material can concentrate electromagnetic fields in a given direction and be made to avoid or surround objects, returning to their original path without pertubation.
        This is consistent with the Maxwell's equations and in principle, is application to all frequencies.
