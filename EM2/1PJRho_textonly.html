        <h4>Polarisation:</h4>
        <p>At the microscopic level, an applied electric field causes a charge separation within an atom. This results
            in the generation of an
            atomic dipole moment:</p>
        $$ \textbf{p}=q \textbf{d}, $$
        <p>where $q$ is the charge in the dipole and $\textbf{d}$ is the charge separation vector [defined from the
            negative end of the dipole to the
            positive end{NEED TO CHECK THIS}]. Hence, polarisation $\textbf{P}$ is defined as</p>
        $$ \textbf{P}=N\textbf{p},$$
        <p>where $N$ is the number density of the atoms. In a homogeneous, isotropic and linear (HIL) {dielectric}
            material, polarisation is
            also defined as</p>
        $$ \textbf{P}= \chi_e \epsilon_0 \textbf{E},$$
        <p>where $\chi_e$ is the electric susceptibility. </p>

        <h4>Charge densities:</h4>
        <div>
            FURTHER EXPLAIN THESE
            <p>$\rho_{sf}$: Free surface charge density, which is zero for a dielectric.</p>
            <p>$\rho_{f}$: Free charge density (within the material), which is zero for a dielectric.</p>
            <p>$\rho_{sp}$: Polarisation surface charge density, which is produced due to bound charges.</p>
            <p>$\rho_{p}$: Polarisation charge density (within the material), which is produced due to bound charges.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Consider a small  element of a dielectric material. When an electric field is applied, atomic dipole moments are generated within atoms due to charge separation.
        The diagram shows a microscopic view of a dielectric and an applied electric field from left to right. As you can see, this results in specific ends of the dipoles sticking of the surface which is parallel
        to the electric field. This results in a charge being developed on these surfaces. The surface charge on Face 1 is </p>
        $$Q_s=qNdA=PA=\textbf{P} \cdot \textbf{A},$$
        <p>where $A$ is the area of Face 1, hence $dA$ is the volume spanned by the dipole layer on the surface. Hence, $\rho_{sp}$ is </p>
        $$\rho_{sp}=\frac{Q_s}{A}=P.$$
        <p>For a non-parallel surface, the new surface area is $\textbf{A}'=A'\hat{\textbf{n}}$, where $A'=A/\cos(\theta)$ (look at the diagram). Therefore, the
        surface charge is</p>
        $$ Q_s'=\textbf{P} \cdot \textbf{A}'= PA'\cos(\theta)=PA.$$
        <p>This equation is the same as that for a parallel face. Hence, the surface charge being developed is the same. This makes sense as the number of dipoles sticking out of the surface
        does not change. However, $\rho_{sp}$ is now </p>
        $$\rho_{sp}=\frac{Q_s'}{A'}=\frac{PA}{A/\cos(\theta)}=P\cos(\theta)=\textbf{P} \cdot \hat{\textbf{n}}.$$
        <p>If we place more of these elements next to each other to construct a shape, we can see that the net charge developed on the shared sides is zero (look at the visualisation on the right).
        Hence, a net surface charge is only developed on the surface of the shape. The surface charge due to polarisation is</p>
        $$ Q_p=\oint \textbf{P} \cdot \textbf{ds}.$$
        <p>Keep in mind that the net charge of the shape before applying an electric field is zero, and no new charges are added or removed. Hence, </p>
        $$ Q_{inside} + Q_{surface}=0,$$
        <p>where</p>
        $$Q_{surface}=\oint \textbf{P} \cdot \textbf{ds}=\int\nabla \cdot \textbf{P} dV,$$
        <p>and</p>
        $$Q_{inside}=\int \rho_{p} dV,$$
        <p> where $\rho_{p}$ is the polarisation charge density. Hence,</p>
        $$ \rho_{p}=-\nabla \cdot \textbf{P}.$$

        <h4>Magnetization:</h4>
        <p> Due to electron's intrinsic property of spin and electric charge, a magnetic dipole moment is generated.
        It is easy to visualise the magnetic dipole moment as the orbital motion of the electron resulting in a current loop around the atom.
        The magnetic dipole moment is defined as</p>
        $$\textbf{m}=I\textbf{A},$$
        <p>where $I$ is the current generated by the electron's motion, and $\textbf{A}$ is the vector defining the area enclosed by the current loop.
        Hence, magnetisation is defined as</p>
        $$\textbf{M}=N\textbf{m},$$
        <p>where $N$ is the number density of atoms in the dielectric. Magnetisation is defined by the Right-hand Thumb Rule.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="current">
        <h4>Current densities:</h4>
        <div>
            <p>$\textbf{J}_{c}$: Conduction current density which is due to movement of free charges</p>
            <p>$\textbf{J}_{sc}$: Surface conduction current density which is due to movement of free charges</p>
            <p>$\textbf{J}_{m}$: Magnetisation current density which is due to movement of bound charges</p>
            <p>$\textbf{J}_{sm}$: Surface magnetisation current density which is due to movement of bound charges</p>
            <p>$\textbf{J}_{p}$: Polarisation current density which is due to movement of bound charges</p>
        </div>
        <p>Consider a small  element of a dielectric material. Taking a layer of this element which is an atom thick, we can see that the net current is generated along the surface
        in a direction determined by the orientation of the current loops (look at the diagram); within the layer, the adjacent current loops act to oppose each other and cancel out. Hence, for the dielectric element, a
        current, $I_{element}$ is generated along the faces which are perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic moment of the element $\textbf{m}_{element}$.</p>
        $$m_{element}=MlA=I_{block}A$$
        <p>where $lA$ is the volume of the element. Hence, Surface magnetisation current density $J_{sm}$, which is defined as current per unit width of the surface, is</p>
        $$J_{sm}=\frac{I_{block}}{L}=\frac{ML}{L}=M$$
        <p>As a vector, $J_{sm}$ is defined as</p>
        $$\textbf{J}_{sm}=\textbf{M} \times \hat{\textbf{n}}$$
        <p>For uniform $\textbf{M}$, meaning that $\textbf{M}$ is that same for each element, when multiple elements are placed adjacent to each other, the current travels along
        the outer faces. The current along the inner shared faces cancel out.</p>
        <p>The Magnetisation current density $\textbf{J}_{m}$ is</p>
        $$\textbf{J}_{m}=\nabla \times \textbf{M}.$$
        <p>Returning to polarisation, polarisation current density can be determined by considering the time variation of $\textbf{P}$:</p>
        $$\textbf{J}_{p}=\frac{\partial \textbf{P}}{\partial t}=Nq\frac{\partial \textbf{d}}{\partial t}=Nq\textbf{v}.$$
        <p>This suggest that there is a variation in the dipole separation over time. Hence, the bound charges move, which produces a current density.</p>
