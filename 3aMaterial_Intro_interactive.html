    <strong>Dielectrics -</strong> contain electrons bonded at an equilibrium separation from their respective nuclei.
      To model the behaviour of dielectrics we treat the electrons as particles attached to their respective nuclei by a spring:
      this is a simplified classical model, but it accounts for the behaviour relatively well.
      <br><br>

      <strong>Binding force -</strong> The actual forces between electrons and their nuclei can be complicated but we
      approximate it as: <br> $F_{binding} = -k_{spring} x = -m \omega_0^2 x$. <br>
      This is for small displacements, since you can expand the potential energy with a Taylor series about the
      equilibrium position, giving: <br> $U(x) = U(0) + x U'(0) + \frac{1}{2} x^2 U''(0) + ...$<br>
      The first term is a constant potential offset which can be ignored, and the second term can be aproximated as zero
      around the equilibrium position. This leaves the third term which can be differentiated to give the expression for
      force we saw earlier, where<br> $k_{spring} = U''(0)$.
      <br><br>

      <strong>Damping force -</strong> As well as the restoring force there is a damping force which is partially caused
      by radiation emitted by the electrons. For simplicity we say that this force is opposite in direction to the velocity.
      It is given by:<br>
      $F_{damping} = -m \gamma \frac{dx}{dt}$<br>
      where m is the mass of the electron and gamma is a proportionality constant.
      <br><br>

      <strong>Driving force -</strong> The E field from an electromagnetic wave can drive the electrons, with a force
      of<br> $F_{driving} = q E_0 cos(\omega t)$<br>
      where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the light.

      <strong>Solving for x - </strong> Putting all these forces into Newton's second law gives a forced oscillator
      equation, with complex solutions.<br>
      $\displaystyle \tilde{x}(t) = \frac{q/m}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2 - i \gamma \omega} E_0 e^{-i \omega t}$
      <br><br>

      <strong>Electric Field in Dielectric - </strong> The dipole moment of each electron nucleus pair, is given by
      $\tilde{p}(t) = q \tilde{x}(t)$. By summing these dipole moments over a volume element, we can find the polarisation
      of the material. <br>
      $\displaystyle \tilde{\mathbf{P}} = \frac{N q^2}{m} \left(\sum_j \frac{f_i}{\omega_j^2 - \omega^2 - i \gamma_j \omega}\right) \tilde{\mathbf{E}}$ <br>
      The electric field is related to the polarisation by $\displaystyle \tilde{\mathbf{P}} = \epsilon_0 \tilde{\chi}_e \tilde{\mathbf{E}}$.
      From this we can find plane wave solutions of the E field inside the dielectric. These are:<br>
      $\displaystyle \tilde{\textbf{E}}(z,t) = \tilde{\textbf{E}}_0  e^{i(\tilde{k}z-\omega t)}$ <br>
      where $\tilde{k}$ is the complex wave number. This can be rearranged to: <br>
      $\displaystyle \tilde{\textbf{E}}(z,t) = \tilde{\textbf{E}}_0(z,t) e^{-\kappa z} e^{i(kz-\omega t)}$ <br>
      where $\kappa$ is the complex part of $\tilde{k}$ and $k$ is the real part.
      <br><br>

      <strong>Attenuation -</strong> From the previous equation it is clear that the imaginary component of $\tilde{k}$
      will cause an exponential decay in the amplitude of the EM wave. Normally in a dielectric the imaginary component
      is very small, however when the frequency of the EM wave approaches the natural frequency of the electron oscillators,
      resonance occurs and the oscillators absorb much more energy from the wave, meaning the material becomes opaque and
      the imaginary component of $\tilde{k}$ becomes significant. Most dielectrics have electron oscillators in several
      different environments, each having it's own natural frequency, meaning the material is opaque over a range of
      frequencies. Transparent materials normally have resonances in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, rather than
      the visible part.
