     <h4>Explanation Column:</h4>
    <p>
        When an electromagnetic wave is incident on a dielectric boundary, some of the wave is reflected and some is transmitted. 
        When the medium containing the incident wave has a greater refractive index than the other medium, there exists a critical angle
        $sin^{-1}(\frac{n2}{n1})$. If the wave is incident at greater than the critical angle, then classically, total internal reflection 
        takes place. But in reality, in a process that is analogous to quantum tunnelling, some of the wave does enter the second medium
        and propagates in a direction parallel to the boundary, but decays in intensity as you move perpendicularly away from the boundary. 
        This is an evanescent wave. (The refractive index of the material is a function of intrinsic properties of the material and the frequency 
        of the electromagnetic wave, but we will not describe those formulae here.)
    </p>

    <p>
        Similar to tunnelling between two potential wells in quantum mechanics, let's say there existed a material 2 of refractive index $n_2$,
        but we introduced a small gap inside of refractive index $n_1$. When a wave travelling in medium 2 strikes medium 1 at greater than 
        the critical angle, total internal reflection takes place, and the transmitted wave in medium 1 decays as you move
        away from the boundary. But once this decaying wave hits medium 2 again, it continues propagating but with a smaller 
        amplitude governed by how much it decayed.
    </p>

    <p>
        The underlying maths of quantum tunnelling and the phenomenon of evanescent waves is exactly the same.
    </p>

    <h4>How to use the visualisation</h4>
    <p>The wave is propagating from left to right. The sliders can be varied to observe the behaviour of the incident, reflected, 
    their comination, and the transmitted waves. Doing this, Snell's Law can be observed.</p>
    <p>To observe the phenomenon of evanescent waves, the angular frequency ratio slider should be varied until $n2 > n1$,
        and then the incident angle slider should be taken to an angle greater than the critical angle.</p>
