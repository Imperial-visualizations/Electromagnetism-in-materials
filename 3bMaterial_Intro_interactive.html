    <span style="font-weight: bold">Conductors - </span>
    A conductor contains mobile free electrons. 
    The positively charged ion left behind is usually fixed so we investigate only the behavior of the free electrons in an electric field.
    <br><br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold">Charge rearrangement time - </span>
    Given some arbitrary electric field, the free electrons would rearrange themselves until the total electric field inside the conductor is 0.
    This arrangement happens within the charge rearrangement time $\tau^{\star} = \frac{\epsilon}{\sigma}$, where $\epsilon = \epsilon_0\epsilon_r$, 
    $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\epsilon_r$ and $\sigma$ are the relative permittivity and the conductivity of the material respectively.
    A physical insight to $\tau^{\star}$ is that $\epsilon$ is 'a measurement of how much the material dampens the electric field felt by the charges' 
    while $\sigma$ is 'a measurement as to how ready is the charge to move given some electric field'.
    So the charge rearrangement time $\tau^{\star}$ is a characteristic of the conductor.
    <br><br>
    Derivation:
    <br>
    Approximating the material to be linear, meaning that charges respond to electric fields by producing a current that is a linear
    function of the electric field they feel, we can use Ohm's law:
    $$ \mathbf{J}_c = \sigma \mathbf{E} $$
    where $\sigma$ is a constant (not a function position because we take the material to be homogenous) 
    scalar (not a tensor because we take the material to be isotropic).
    <br><br>
    Conservation of free charge requires 
    $$ \frac{\partial \rho_f}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_c $$
    Substituting Ohm's Law for the electric field, 
    $$ \frac{\partial \rho_f}{\partial t} = - \sigma \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} $$
    $$ = - \sigma \frac{\rho_f}{\epsilon} = - \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} \rho_f$$
    So,
    $$ \rho_f = \rho_{f, initial} e^{-\frac{t}{\tau^{\star}}} $$
    where $\tau^{\star} = \frac{\epsilon}{\sigma}$.
    <br><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Good or poor conductor ? </span>
    Not to be confused with electrical conductivity, the conductivity we are talking about here is how responsive the material is to any changes in the electric field applied to it.
    We consider only oscillatory electric fields (or alternating current) to test the material so $E_{applied} \propto e^{-i \omega t}$,
    where $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ is the angular frequency of the field.
    <br><br>
    <b>Now we ask the question: Are the free electrons rearranging themselves fast enough to 'cancel out' $\mathbf{E}_{applied}$?</b>
    In other words, we want to know if the timescale of electron movement is small enough relative to the timescale of the electric field
    changing in order for $\mathbf{E}_{applied}$ to be cancelled out. And so an important quantity for us
    is the ratio of timescales $\frac{\tau^{\star}}{T}$.
    That ratio turns out to be $\frac{\tau^{\star}}{T} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{\mid \mathbf{J}_d \mid}{\mid \mathbf{J}_c \mid} $, 
    or $\omega \tau^{\star} = \frac{\mid \mathbf{J}_d \mid}{\mid \mathbf{J}_c \mid} $, which is shown later.
    <br><br>
    If the <b>free electrons take much less time </b> than the wave period to rearrange, i.e. $\omega \tau^{\star} \ll 1$, 
    then we expect the material to be a <b>good conductor</b>, as they can move quickly enough to 
    cancel out the applied field.
    The 'good conductor' criterion depends on $\omega$ and $\tau^{\star}$ so it depends on both the material <b>and the applied electric field</b>.
    <br><br>
    The conduction current density is
    $$ \mathbf{J}_c = \sigma \mathbf{E}_{applied}, $$
    (This is the same from the Ohm's law approximation as above)
    <br>
    $ \mathbf{J}_c $ is a current density due to electrons experiencing a <b>non-zero electric field</b>. 
    Notice $\sigma$ is a property of the material, which relates the electric field to the observed conduction current.
    <br><br>
    The displacement current density is
    $$ \mathbf{J}_d = \frac{\partial \mathbf{D}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial }{\partial t} (\epsilon \mathbf{E}_{applied})$$
    $ \mathbf{J}_d $ is an apparent current density due to <b>the rate of change of the electric field</b>. 
    Notice $\epsilon$ is a property of the material, which relates the electric field to the observed displacement current.
    Notice that both the conduction current density and the displacement current density are linearly proportional to 
    the amplitude of the applied electric field (if the field amplitude is doubled, the rate of change of the field value 
    is also doubled).
    In this case, $E_{applied} \propto e^{-i \omega t}$, and so 
    $$ \mathbf{J}_d = -i \omega \epsilon \mathbf{E}_{applied} $$
    We only care about how quickly the field is changing and the material properties in order to classify a good or a poor conductor, not about
    the value of the field itself. We can achieve such a quantity by dividing the magnitudes of the two currents, as both are only linearly
    proportional to the electric field amplitude.

    $$ \frac{\mid \mathbf{J}_d \mid}{\mid \mathbf{J}_c \mid} = \frac{\omega \epsilon}{\sigma} $$
    Using the charge rearrangement time $\tau^{\star} = \frac{\epsilon}{\sigma}$, we see
    $$ \frac{\omega \epsilon}{\sigma} = \omega \tau^{\star} = 2\pi \frac{\tau^{\star}}{T} $$ which is the ratio of electron movement timescale
    to the field timescale (period). And so $$\frac{\omega \epsilon}{\sigma}$$ dictates whether the material is a good conductor
    for an EM field of that frequency.
    <br><br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Skin Effect - </span>
    When an alternating current passes through a conductor, the alternating electric field produces an alternating magnetic field.
    This magnetic field in turn creates an electric field that opposes the original alternating current, known as the "back emf".
    The back emf is the strongest at the centre of a conductor, pushing the current to the surface of the conductor.
    <br>
      The current diffusion equation is given by
      $$ \nabla^2 \mathbf{J}_c = \mu_0 \sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{J}_c}{\partial t}$$
      where $\mathbf{J}_c$ is the conduction current density in the conductor.
      The LHS of the above above equation gives the gradient field of the flow of current density in the conductor.
      The current density of an alternating current in a cylindrical wire can be written as
      $\mathbf{J}_c = \widetilde{J}_c (r) e^{-i \omega t} \mathbf{\hat{z}}$, which gives
      $$\nabla^2 \widetilde{J}_c = -\kappa ^2 \widetilde{J}_c $$
      where $\kappa^2 = i \omega \mu_0 \sigma$.
      This is a Helmholtz Equation, where $\kappa$ provides a measure of the wavenumber.
      Hence,
      $$\kappa = \sqrt{\mu_0 \omega \sigma} \, i^{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\delta}$$
      where $\delta = \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\mu_0 \sigma \omega} }$ is the skin depth, a current diffusion lengthscale.
      This means that $J_c$ reduces by a factor of $\frac{1}{e}$ after travelling for one $\delta$.
    <br>
      Let $a$ be the radius of a wire. If the AC frequency $( \omega )$ is low, $\delta = \sqrt{ \frac{2}{\mu_0 \sigma \omega} } \gg a$
      and $\mathbf{J}_c$ is roughly uniform throughout the wire. However, if $\omega$ is high, $\delta \ll a$ and $\mathbf{J}_c$ is
      confined within the layer of width $\approx \delta$ on the surface on the wire.
