    <span style="font-weight: bold">The Drude Model - </span>
    The Drude Model studies the motion of electrons in material by assuming that there are only two forces on the electrons,
    (1) electric force from applied electric field, $\mathbf{F}_E$
    (2) force arises from the collisions among the electrons and between electrons and ions, $\mathbf{F}_c$
    so the coulombic forces between electrons and ions are neglected.
    <br><br>
    By Newton's second law of motion,
    $$ m \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{F}_{total} = \mathbf{F}_E + \mathbf{F}_c $$
    So,
    $$ m_e \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}_e}{\partial t} = -e \mathbf{E} - \frac{m_e \mathbf{v}_e}{\tau_c} $$
    where $\tau_c$ is the electron collision time.
    <br><br>
    We consider only oscillatory electric fields (or alternating current) to test the material so $E_{applied} \propto e^{-i \omega t}$
    or $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{-i \omega t}$,
    where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the field and $\mathbf{E}_0$ is real. 
    In this case, the solution to the equation is such that $\mathbf{v}_e \propto e^{-i \omega t}$.
    <br><br>
    Now we obtain
    $$-i \omega t m_e \mathbf{v}_e = -e \mathbf{E} - \frac{m_e \mathbf{v}_e}{\tau_c} $$
    so
    $$ \mathbf{v}_e = -\frac{e}{m_e} \frac{\tau_c}{1-i \omega \tau_c} \mathbf{E}$$
    Recall that the conduction current density is given by
    $$\mathbf{J}_c = N_i e \mathbf{v}_i - N_e e \mathbf{v}_e$$
    where N is the number density, subscript $i$ is for ions and $e$ for electrons.
    In general, $\mathbf{v}_e \gg \mathbf{v}_i$ given the same initial conditions for ions and electrons because ions are much heavier than electrons.
    We assume that the first term tends to zero so
    $$\mathbf{J}_c = - N_e e \mathbf{v}_e$$
    Taking the result for $\mathbf{v}_e$ from above, we get
    $$\mathbf{J}_c = \frac{\sigma \mathbf{E}}{1 - i \omega \tau_c}$$
    where $\sigma = \frac{N_e e^2 \tau_c}{m_e}$.
    We can rewrite $\mathbf{J}_c$ in terms of complex exponential form:
    $$ \mathbf{J}_c = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{1+\omega^2 \tau^2}} e^{i\tan^{-1} {(\omega \tau})} \mathbf{E} $$
    The phase shift of $\mathbf{J}_c$ to $\mathbf{E}$ is given by $\tan^{-1} {(\omega \tau})$.
    An alternative way of looking at the phase shift between $\mathbf{J}_c$ and $\mathbf{E}$
    is that $\mathbf{J}_c$ is analogous to the velocity of the electrons and 
    $\mathbf{E}$ is analogous to the acceleration of the electrons. 
    (In fact, it is just a matter of scalling.)
    <br><br>
    This phase shift comes out of the fact that this is effectively a damped driven harmonic oscillation. 
    The source of the driving force is the applied electric field while the source of the damping force is 
    the collisions between electrons or electrons and ions.
    <br><br>
    In a damped driven harmonic oscillation, the phase shift of the steady state is due to 
    the amount of time for the transient phase to decay away.
    <br><br>

    <span style="font-weight: bold">Plasmas in oscillatory electric field - </span>
    We shall only talk about <b>collisionless</b> plasmas.
    Based on the Drude Model,
    $$\mathbf{J}_c = \frac{N_e e^2 \tau_c}{m_e \sqrt{1+\omega^2 \tau^2}} e^{i\tan^{-1} {(\omega \tau})} \mathbf{E}_{applied}$$
    where $\mathbf{E}_{applied}$ is the applied electric field.
    The <b>phase shift</b> between $\mathbf{J}_c$ to $\mathbf{E}_{applied}$ is given by $\tan^{-1} {(\omega \tau})$.
    <br><br>
    We consider only oscillatory electric fields (or alternating current) to test the material so $\mathbf{E}_{applied} = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{-i \omega t}$,
    where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the field and $\mathbf{E}_0$ is real. 
    <br><br>
    In collisionless plasmas, the electron collision time $\tau_c$ is much greater than
    the 'field timescale' $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$, i.e. $\tau_c \gg T$ or $\frac{\tau_c}{T} \gg 1$ so $\omega \tau_c \gg 1$.
    Taking the limits $\omega \tau_c + 1 \rightarrow \omega \tau_c$ and $\tan^{-1} {(\omega \tau}) \rightarrow \frac{\pi}{2}$, 
    $$\mathbf{J}_c \approx \frac{N_e e^2 \tau_c}{m_e} e^{i \frac{\pi}{2}} \mathbf{E}_{applied} $$
    $E^{real}$ and $J^{real}_c$ are out of phase by $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

    <span style="font-weight: bold">Plasmas oscillation - </span>
    Consider a cloud of neutral plasma left alone to reach its equilibrium distribution in the absence of external electromagnetic field.
    What happens if we displace one of the electrons in the plasma slightly?
    (Hint: the keywords are <b>equilibrium</b> and <b>displace slightly</b>.)
    <br><br>
    The electron should be sitting at the bottom of the potential well initially. 
    The small displacement will result in simple harmonic motion of the electron.
    Since plasma is a cloud of free electrons and ions, this small displacement actually causes the entire cloud to oscillate
    hence the collective behaviour of plasma oscillations.
    <br><br>
    It turns out that plasma oscillates at the plasma frequency:
    $$\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{N_e e^2}{m_e \epsilon_0}}$$
    where $N_e$ is the number density of electrons, $e$ is the fundamental charge and $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.
    Notice how the plasma frequency here depends only on the characteristics of electron distribution.
    This is due to the assumption that the electrons moving much faster than the positive ions in a neutral plasma.
    <br><br>
    How do we justify this assumption?
    Consider the lightest element, hydrogen. Ignoring the heavier isotopes, the simplest hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron. 
    The mass of a proton is roughly 1800 times greater than that of an electron. 
    Given the same initial conditions, an electron would be accelerated much more than a proton in an electric field that is not too strong.
    Therefore, in any plasmas, the positive ions are always much heavier than the electrons and so the movement of the positive ions can be ignored 
    given that the electric field is not too strong.
    <br><br>
    Derivation:
    Displacing an electron in a neutral plasma means that the number density of electron, $N_e$ depends on the position and time.
    Let $N_e = N_0 + N_1 (x, t)$, where $N_0$ is the initial number density of electron and $x$ is the direction of perturbation.
    Generally, the free charge density $\rho_f$ is given by $\rho_f = N_i e - N_e e$, where $N_i$ is the number density of positive ions.
    In this case, $\rho_f = N_i e - (N_0 + N_1(x, t))e$ but $N_i e = N_0 e$ for a neutral plasma so 
    $$\rho_f = -N_1(x, t)e$$
    Also, in general, the conduction current density $\mathbf{J}_c$ is given by 
    $$\mathbf{J}_c = N_i e \mathbf{v}_e - N_e e \mathbf{v}_e$$
    Based on the assumption of small perturbation of electron such that the movements of positive ions can be ignored, the first term vanishes so
    $\mathbf{J}_c = - N_e e \mathbf{v}_e = -(N_0 + N_1(x, t)) e \mathbf{v}_e$. Also based on the assumption of small perturbation, $N_0 \gg N_1$
    so $$\mathbf{J}_c = - N_0 e \mathbf{v}_e$$
    In a closed system, we require conservation of free charge,
    $$\frac{\partial \rho_f}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_c = 0$$
    so,
    $$-e\frac{\partial N_1}{\partial t} - N_0 e \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}_e = 0$$
    Consider only in the direction of perturbation,
    $$-e\frac{\partial N_1}{\partial t} - N_0 e \frac{\partial v_{e, x}}{\partial x} = 0$$
    We can rewrite this as
    $$\frac{\partial v_{e, x}}{\partial x} = -\frac{1}{N_0} \frac{\partial N_1}{\partial t}$$
    Velocity must be continuous with respect to space and time (If it was not, it would mean we would be using 'infinite forces').
    Given that its continuous, 
    $$\frac{\partial^2 v_{e, x}}{\partial x \partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 v_{e, x}}{\partial t \partial x}$$
    We get (1):
    $$\frac{\partial^2 v_{e, x}}{\partial x \partial t} = -\frac{1}{N_0} \frac{\partial^2 N_1}{\partial t^2}$$
    By Gauss' Law for electrostatics,
    $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
    where $\rho = \rho_f + \rho_p$, $\rho_f$ is the free charge density while $\rho_p$ is the polarisation charge density.
    In plasmas, $\rho_p = 0$ so 
    $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_f}{\epsilon_0}$$
    From the result above, $\rho_f = -N_1(x, t)e$ so
    $$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = -\frac{N_1 e}{\epsilon_0}$$
    Consider only in the direction of perturbation,
    $$\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial x} = -\frac{N_1 e}{\epsilon_0}$$
    Now, by Newton's second law,
    $$m_e \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}_e}{\partial t} = -e \mathbf{E}$$
    Consider only in the direction of perturbation,
    $$m_e \frac{\partial v_{e, x}}{\partial t} = -e E_x$$
    So
    $$\frac{\partial^2 v_{e, x}}{\partial x \partial t} = - \frac{e}{m_e} \frac{\partial E_x}{\partial x}$$
    From the result for $\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial x}$ above, we obtain (2):
    $$\frac{\partial^2 v_{e, x}}{\partial x \partial t} = - \frac{e}{m_e} \cdot -\frac{N_1 e}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{e^2}{m_e \epsilon_0} N_1 $$
    Equating (1) and (2) and rearranging the result,
    $$\frac{\partial^2 N_1}{\partial t^2} + \frac{N_0 e^2}{m_e \epsilon_0} N_1 = 0$$
    This is the equation of simple harmonic motion for plasma, with a natural frequency of 
    $$\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{N_0 e^2}{m_e \epsilon_0}}$$
